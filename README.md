# TSM and HO-TSM Supplementary Repository

This repository provides the supplementary material corresponding to two research papers:

- [`TSM/`](./TSM/) — **Time Sharing Masking (TSM)**, published in *TCHES 2024*
- [`HO_TSM/`](./HO_TSM/) — **Higher-Order Time Sharing Masking (HO-TSM)**, published in *TCHES 2025*

Both contributions introduce efficient, low-latency masking schemes for securing hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms against side-channel attacks.
